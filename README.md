# Analysis The Top Movie Streaming | NETFLIX | Amazon Prime | Hulu | Disney World with python in jupyter notebook

Having data where top straming service privder's data is present like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney. Where i found the inside regarding number of movies for specific age group in each service,better ratting , runetime of movies, different languages used in streaming, rotten tomatoes score ,director and their directed movies and much more.

Columns in Data are: 
1. Title : which gives name of movies
2. Year : on which year the movie is released.
3. Age : different age are mentioned like 13+, 0 which means for all ages  and so on.
4. IMDb rating: an acronym for Internet Movie Database and      range    is from 0 to 10.
5. Rotton Tomatoes: A Tomatometer score is calculated for a movie or TV show after it receives at least five reviews. When at least 60% of reviews for a movie or TV show are positive, a red tomato is displayed to indicate its Fresh status.
Rotten Tomatoes gives films a score out of 100 based on the averaged reviews of professional film critics. If a film gets a rating of 60 or more it gets a 'fresh' red tomato on the site. Less than 60 and it gets a rotten tomato.

6. Netflix : show movies from netflix where it is 1 and 0 means no netflix movie.
7. Prime Video: show movies from Prime Video where it is 1 and 0 means no Prime Video movie. and same for Hulu and Disney+ 
8. Directors : Name of director who directed the movies
9. Genres : nature of video/movies either it is drama ,adventure or something else.
10. languages : in which language that movie is present .
11. Runetime : the length of movie.

The Insights From This Project I have Drawn are:
1. checking top 10 languages in this streaming services.
2. number of movies for specific age group
3. number of movies for specific age group in each service.
4. overall rotten tomatoes score and as well for each streaming services.
5. IMDb rating
6. finding runtime of movies
